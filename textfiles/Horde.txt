CMPUT 275 Winter 2014

Title: Horde
Team Members: Ross Anderson, Andrew Bradshaw

Description:
A 2D side-view survival game. The code will use classes and inheritance to model the monsters.
The project will be written in Python 3 using pygame.

Milestone 1:
Basic rendering of character model and map. Character movement in response to input. Physics (floors + walls).

Milestone 2:
Stationary monsters that spawn at irregular intervals at predefined locations.
Character can jump on a monster to kill it.

Milestone 3:
Monsters chase character unintelligently. Character has health, and can be damaged by monsters. 
Character can punch/kick to kill monsters. 

Milestone 4:
Point tracking + local highscores. Game ends when character health reaches 0.
Title screen.

Optional:
Teleportation from various locations in the level.
Multiple level geometries.
Online highscores.
Other monster types (spiky, fast, double-health, etc)
Other monster AIs/strategies (i.e. A* pathfinding, different "AIs" use different heuristics)


Our demonstration will be a playable version of the game.
