# Run or Get COOKED

**Super Mario** and **Pac-man** are both highly influenced in this game. Because the hackathon's subject is **food**, So, I decided to make this game called **Run or get cooked**. Instead of Pac-Man or Mario, we get a charming **lobster** attempting to **flee** from the chef who intends to cook him. Let's see whether the lobster can make it.

## What it does ‚ùì

You as a **lobster** must flee before the chef's can catch you and cook you and eat. The lobster has to survive as long as he could. There are 2 chefs,  **white chef** and **orange chef**, in this game. You have **3 health points** to survive, if all lost then you are doomed to be cooked. There is also a **high score** tab where people can see their score.

**KEYBOARD COMMANDS**:

  - [<] = run to left
  - [>] = run to right
  - [^] = to jump
  - [Space bar] = to Pinch the chef's

**HOW TO PLAY**:
- You have to press **Space bar** to start the game
- To move the lobster, you have to use the **arrow keys**
- By pressing the **upward arrow** [^] key, the lobster can **jump**
- By pressing the **Space bar**, the lobster can **pinch** the chef and earn points
- To kill the **white chef**, you can either jump on top of them or pinch them
- To kill the **Orange chef**, you have to pinch them
